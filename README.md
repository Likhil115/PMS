my-app is frontend directory 
Backend in backend directory
and integrated both in PMS so that you can run them directly from PMS directory means project directory using "npm start"
you need to install node and mongodb on your system before running this
and try npm install in each directory to install all required packages in package.json file
That's it you are ready to go.
